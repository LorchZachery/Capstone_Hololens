Ask de frites how andriod application works in general. This code can send location updates to database so the halolens knows its own location. each delete and add will add it to the database. You need to be on the Ravpower LAN to update the database.

the gui has two screens one is the bomb info and one is the map so you can see where you are in relation to each bomb. this is super helpful when debugging the halolens. click on a bomb to delete it. click on the map to add a bomb
