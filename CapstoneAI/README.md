Main README goes over suggestions for first interactions and how to run this code. Unused files are boundingBoxes.txt, dp_connect.py (relevant code snippets were copied over to main.py), object_select_track.py, realsense_test_image.png, and yolo_realsense.py. Outside of what was previously mentioned in parentheses, I did not interact with any of these scripts in any way but kept them in because they (besides dp_connect.py) were a part of Dr. Novotny's original git repo.
